//! The Overlooker **engine** — the timer, dispatcher, and round executor that
//! run inside the loom daemon (the single owner of the terminal/session runtime).
//!
//! The storage + model (`Overlooker`, `Trigger`, `Scope`, the run audit) lives
//! in [`weaver_core::overlooker`]; this module is the live machinery that turns
//! those rows into action. It is built as **two halves of one event loop**, the
//! design of record in `docs/plans/overlooker.md`:
//!
//! * **The timer (producer).** For each enabled scheduled overlooker it keeps a
//!   `next_run_at`, and when due writes a `cron` system event into the same
//!   `events` stream session changes flow through — nothing more. A cron tick is
//!   a first-class, logged row.
//! * **The dispatcher (consumer).** A sibling of [`crate::monitor::run`] on its
//!   own independent watermark: it reads `events::since`, and for each new event
//!   fires every enabled overlooker whose trigger matches — a scheduled one
//!   matches its own `cron` tick, a reactive one matches a `tag` write (the
//!   tag's key/value become the trigger's match kind/level, so `attention` and
//!   `triage` tags still drive `{event:"attention"|"triage"}` triggers) or a
//!   `stale` tick, and `manual` ticks (operator "run now") fire the named
//!   overlooker.
//!
//! Both halves are folded into one [`run`] loop, self-gated on the
//! `overlooker.enabled` master switch so the daemon can always spawn it and it
//! idles cheaply when off.
//!
//! A **round** is one execution ([`fire`]). It is **level-triggered**: the event
//! that woke it is only a nudge to re-survey the *current* scoped fleet — it
//! never "handles" the specific event, so firing twice is idempotent. The round
//! runs a **program** under the non-optional guardrails — no-overlap, cooldown,
//! timeout, no-recursion — and records every mutating action as both an
//! `overlooker_runs` action entry and an `events` row (the audit rule). Two
//! program shapes share that one substrate ([`run_program`]): the builtin
//! **scripts** embedded from [`crate::builtins`] and custom program files —
//! both run by the same subprocess executor ([`run_script`]), reaching the
//! fleet only through the loom REST API.
