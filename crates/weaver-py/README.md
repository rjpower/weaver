# weaver-py

A Pythonic, synchronous wrapper over [`weaver-api`](../weaver-api) — drive the
loom fleet from Python, capability-gated. This is the out-of-process seam of the
[overlooker design](../../docs/plans/overlooker.md): a scripted overlooker (or an
agent iterating on one, or a human at a REPL) talks to the loom daemon through
the same typed REST surface the `loom` CLI uses, never touching the terminal runtime directly.
The daemon stays the single owner of the live runtime.

## Install

The module is a PyO3 extension built with [maturin](https://www.maturin.rs/).
It is kept out of the Cargo workspace (it links libpython), so build it on its
own:

```bash
# Editable install into the active virtualenv (fast iteration):
pip install maturin
maturin develop --manifest-path crates/weaver-py/Cargo.toml

# …or build a portable wheel and install that:
maturin build --release --manifest-path crates/weaver-py/Cargo.toml
pip install target/wheels/weaver_py-*.whl
```

The wheel is `abi3` for CPython ≥ 3.9, so one build runs on any supported Python.

## Use

```python
import weaver_py

# observe-only by default; grant the rungs of the ladder you need
c = weaver_py.Client(base="http://127.0.0.1:7420",
                     capabilities=["observe", "mark", "nudge"])

for s in c.sessions():
    branch = s["branch"]
    # Status lives in `branch["tags"]`, a list of {key, value, note, set_by,
    # set_at}. The well-known keys are `attention` (the agent's self-report) and
    # `triage` (an overlooker's assessment); a missing key means calm.
    tags = {t["key"]: t["value"] for t in branch["tags"]}
    print(s["id"], branch["title"], branch["description"],
          tags.get("attention", "calm"), tags.get("triage", "calm"))

s = c.session("abc123")            # by id, branch id, branch name, or repo:branch
screen = c.preview("abc123", 200)  # terminal as text, 200 lines of scrollback
tree = c.diff("abc123")            # worktree file tree + change map

c.set_tag("abc123", "triage", "attention", note="stuck on tests")  # needs "mark"
c.clear_tag("abc123", "triage")                          # back to calm; needs "mark"
c.mark("abc123", level="attention", note="stuck on tests")  # triage-tag shortcut; "mark"
c.nudge("abc123", "try running the tests again")            # needs "nudge"
c.interrupt("abc123")                                       # needs "interrupt"
```

`base` defaults to `$WEAVER_API` (a URL or a bare `host:port`), falling back to
the loom default `http://127.0.0.1:7878` — the same env convention
`loom::endpoint` uses. So a bare `weaver_py.Client()` targets the local loom.

Responses cross into Python as plain dicts/lists (via `serde_json` →
`pythonize`), so you read `s["branch"]["tags"]` directly; there is no wrapper
class to learn per response type. A type stub (`python/weaver_py.pyi`) ships the
surface for editors and type checkers.

## The capability model

Acting on *other people's* sessions is a loaded gun, so the binding enforces the
**intervention ladder** — least-privilege, rung by rung. A `Client` is
constructed with its granted set; every mutating method gates on its capability
*before* any request leaves the process and raises `CapabilityDenied` if the
grant is absent.

| Capability  | Gates                                    | Default  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|----------|
| `observe`   | all reads (`sessions`/`session`/`preview`/`diff`) | always on |
| `mark`      | write a tag (`set_tag`/`clear_tag`/`mark`) | opt-in   |
| `escalate`  | raise the overlooker's own attention     | opt-in   |
| `nudge`     | `nudge` — type a message into a session  | opt-in   |
| `interrupt` | `interrupt` — break the agent's turn     | opt-in   |
| `launch`    | spawn new sessions (highest privilege)   | opt-in   |

`observe` is implicit — read methods always work, even with an empty grant.
`c.can("nudge")` reports whether a capability is held, mirroring the engine's
`ov.can(...)` so a program can branch on its own grants.

The gate itself is a pure function, `weaver_api::capability::require`, unit-tested
in the `weaver-api` crate (the workspace `test` job) — the security-relevant
core lives below the pyo3 glue, not buried in it.

### Not yet available

`warm_session()` (the overlooker's persistent session) and `run_agent()` (a
fresh one-shot judgement agent) are named in the design but not backed by the
REST client today: `warm_session` is the warm-session lifecycle (plan T12), and
`run_agent` is an in-process engine helper, not an out-of-process endpoint. They
raise `NotImplementedError` rather than faking a result — `run_agent` checks the
`launch` capability first.

## Example

[`examples/fleet_status.py`](examples/fleet_status.py) is the acceptance demo —
query the fleet and, capabilities permitting, mark a session:

```bash
python crates/weaver-py/examples/fleet_status.py
python crates/weaver-py/examples/fleet_status.py --mark <session> attention "looks stuck"
```

## Tests

```bash
maturin develop --manifest-path crates/weaver-py/Cargo.toml
pytest crates/weaver-py/tests
```

`tests/test_capabilities.py` is the security contract: it needs no server and is
the CI coverage — it asserts each mutating method raises when its capability is
absent, before any request is made.

`tests/test_live_roundtrip.py` is a live round-trip against a **fully-isolated**
loom (its own temp `WEAVER_HOME` / `WEAVER_DB`, its own terminal sockets under that home,
an ephemeral port, torn down on exit — it never touches your real loom). It is
opt-in:

```bash
cargo build -p loom            # the live test needs the `loom` binary
WEAVER_PY_LIVE=1 pytest crates/weaver-py/tests/test_live_roundtrip.py -v
```
