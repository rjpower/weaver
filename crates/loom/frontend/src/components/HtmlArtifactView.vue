// source.
//
// Isolation is the whole point: the frame is `srcdoc` with `allow-scripts` but
// *not* `allow-same-origin`, so the document runs in a unique opaque origin. Its
// scripts execute, but it cannot read loom's cookies, localStorage, or call the
// API as the signed-in user — a hostile artifact is sealed off from the session
// it was written to. (Combining allow-scripts with allow-same-origin would let
// it script its way out of the sandbox, so we never do.)
