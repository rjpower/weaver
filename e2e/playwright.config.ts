// so each starts clean. Workers are fully isolated — own WEAVER_HOME/db and port
// (the home also scopes the tapestry sockets) — so tests run in parallel safely.
// `globalSetup`
// builds the binaries + SPA once up front so workers don't race on `cargo build`.
// Tests are deterministic with the `shell` agent.
