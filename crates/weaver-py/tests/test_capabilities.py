"""The security contract: capability gating, with no server required.

These run in CI (the `python-binding` job). They assert that a `Client` built
without a capability *cannot* perform the action it gates — the gate fires
before any request leaves the process, so no loom server is involved. This is
the one test that must always pass: it is the proof that the intervention
ladder is enforced at the binding.
