# weaver

A lightweight per-branch task tracker, plus an optional orchestrator that runs
coding agents in managed terminals.

weaver ships two binaries:

- **`weaver`** — the **agent-facing CLI**. It is database-direct (no daemon,
  no HTTP) and runs sub-50ms cold. The agent inside a worktree uses it to
  read and update the branch's **goal**, **description**, **notes**, and the
  repo's **issues** (each claimed by a branch or sitting in the shared
  backlog). It works whether or not the orchestrator is running.
- **`loom`** — the **optional orchestrator**. It runs the REST + SSE server,
  hosts a Vue dashboard, creates worktrees, launches agents into managed
  terminals, and periodically summarizes each branch's diff against its merge
  base. Without loom, branches and issues still work; the terminals + the
  dashboard do not.

Both binaries share one sqlite database at `~/.weaver/weaver.db`.

## Getting Started

The fastest way in is to **have your coding agent set weaver up for you**: open
this repo in Claude Code (or your agent of choice) and tell it to *"set weaver up
for me — follow the Getting Started steps in the README."* The steps below are
written for it to run; do them yourself if you'd rather.

1. **Get a Rust toolchain.** If `cargo` isn't already on the PATH, install it
   via [rustup](https://rustup.rs):

   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Build the tooling.** From the repo root:

   ```sh
   cargo build
   ```

   This produces `target/debug/weaver` and `target/debug/loom`.

3. **Put both binaries on the PATH.** Symlink them into a directory already on
   `$PATH` (e.g. `~/.local/bin`), so they stay current as you rebuild:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
   ln -sf "$PWD/target/debug/weaver" ~/.local/bin/weaver
   ln -sf "$PWD/target/debug/loom"   ~/.local/bin/loom
   ```

   If `~/.local/bin` isn't on your `$PATH`, add it (e.g.
   `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` in your shell profile).

Then start the orchestrator and open the dashboard:

```sh
loom server run     # REST + SSE server, terminal launcher, background monitor
loom open      # open the web UI (http://127.0.0.1:7878)
```

`weaver` needs no running daemon — it talks straight to the sqlite db — so the
agent inside a worktree works the moment it's on your PATH. `loom server run` is only
for the dashboard, terminal sessions, and summaries. See [Usage](#usage) for the
full command surface, and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the build/test loop and how
to work on weaver itself.

## Architecture

```
weaver CLI ──sqlite──┐
                     ├─ ~/.weaver/weaver.db   (shared, WAL mode)
loom server run ────┘
  │
  ├─ axum REST + SSE (127.0.0.1:7878)
  ├─ terminal supervisors + git worktree wrappers
  ├─ agent launcher (Claude / shell / custom command)
  ├─ background monitor (status, orphan detection, hook ingest)
  ├─ background summarizer (headless agent → branch description)
  └─ Vue SPA at /
```

Agents call `weaver hook` to report status; the loom monitor sees the new
`events` row on its next tick and flips the session's status. This is the
key decoupling — the agent CLI never speaks HTTP.

## Usage

```sh
# Orchestrator (optional)
loom server run                            # run the daemon (REST + UI + terminals + monitor)
loom session launch "Add a /health endpoint"               # new worktree + terminal + agent, seeded with the task
loom session launch "Refactor the parser" --name parser-refactor   # override the branch slug
loom session launch "Big refactor" --model opus --effort high      # pick model tier + reasoning effort
loom session poll <session>           # one-shot status (lifecycle + attention)
loom session wait <session>           # block until it finishes or needs you
loom session send <session> "try the curl again"   # type a message + Enter (trigger an agent round)
loom session break <session>          # send Escape — interrupt the current turn
loom session preview <session>        # print the recent terminal screen
loom ps                               # list active sessions
loom session show <branch>                    # session detail
loom attach <branch>                  # attach your terminal to the session (or use the browser terminal)
loom session archive <branch>                 # tear down terminal + worktree, keep branch + history
loom session adopt <branch>                   # recreate the terminal for an orphaned session
loom session rm <branch>                      # remove worktree + terminal + db row
loom open                             # open the web UI

# Agent-facing (run from inside the worktree, no daemon required)
weaver goal "ship the feature"
weaver goal                           # print the current goal
weaver summary                        # goal + outstanding tasks + next-step hints
weaver status attention "ready for review"   # level (ok|attention|blocked) + current-state message
weaver issue add "Backfill old rows" --body "ETA after the schema change"
weaver issue add "Audit the logger" --repo   # unclaimed repo backlog item
weaver issue ls                       # this branch's work + the repo backlog
weaver issue ls --mine                # just this branch's claimed issues
weaver issue ls --repo                # the whole repo, grouped by branch
weaver issue close 7
weaver issue show 7                   # an issue + the live status of the branch working it
weaver issue wait 7                   # block until a sub-session finishes or needs you
weaver status                     # read: goal + status + open-issue count
weaver where                          # debug: print resolved repo / branch / branch-id
weaver log --limit 50                 # recent events for the current branch
weaver chatlog                        # render this worktree's agent conversation as markdown
```

`loom session` is the uniform surface for driving a child session. `loom
session launch`'s positional argument is the **task**: it becomes the branch
goal and the agent's opening prompt, and the `weaver/<slug>` branch name is
derived from it (override with `--name`). The agent is `claude` unless you pass
`--agent` or change `agent.default`, so the common case is just `loom session
launch "<what to do>"`. A launch with no task and nothing to pick up prints a
usage hint and exits without launching. New branches fork from a
freshly-fetched `origin/<default branch>` — the latest mainline — unless you
pin a parent with `--base` (also a field in the web create form).

Once a session is up, the other verbs interact with it: `loom session poll`
reads its status, `loom session wait` blocks until it finishes or raises
attention, `loom session send` types a message into the agent's terminal (and
submits it to trigger a round), `loom session break` sends Escape to interrupt
the current turn, and `loom session preview` prints the recent terminal screen.
Each takes a session key — an id, branch id, branch name, or `repo:branch`.

Three flags seed the task from existing work instead of a fresh description:
`loom session launch --issue 123` takes the branch's title / goal / description
from a GitHub issue (via the `gh` CLI), `--claim 7` takes them from an existing
weaver issue and moves it out of the repo backlog, and `--branch <name>` resumes
an existing branch. `loom issue ls` prints the repo's board across branches.

Every launch opens a **tracking issue** claimed by the new branch — the task as
a weaver issue — and the launch prints its number. That number is the handle
for following the session: `weaver issue show <n>` reports the issue plus the
live `status` of the branch working it, and `weaver issue wait <n>` blocks
until the issue closes or that branch raises its attention. The launched agent
is told to keep its status current and close the issue when the work is done.
When an agent already inside a weaver session runs `loom session launch`, the
tracking issue is attributed to it (`source_branch`), so its sub-trees show up
under "Delegated by this branch" in `weaver issue ls` — agents can fan work out
into parallel sub-sessions and poll or block on them the same way a human does.

`loom session launch --model <model> --effort <effort>` (both also selectors in
the web create form) pins the session's model selector and reasoning effort.
The selected agent type advertises its available models/efforts and translates
them into its own launch flags (`claude` and `codex` are built in; `shell`
ignores them). Both are stored per session, so adopting a recovered session
resumes with the same settings. Omit either to use the configured default, or
the runtime's own default when no configured default is set.

## Status & attention

Status has two independent axes.

The **lifecycle** (`session.status`) is mechanical and orchestrator-owned:
`created`, `launching`, `running`, `orphaned`, `done`, or `error`. `done` and
`error` are terminal; the rest, including `orphaned`, are recoverable. Claude-
backed sessions drive it via Claude Code hooks installed into
`.claude/settings.local.json` by `loom session launch`. Each hook shells out to
`weaver hook --event {working|waiting|idle|session-start}`, writing an `events`
row the monitor consumes on its next tick; any hook means the agent process is
alive → `running`. When Claude blocks asking the user (the `waiting`/Notification
hook), the monitor raises the branch's **attention** to `attention`; the live
prompt itself is read straight from the terminal, one tab away.

The **attention** axis is the agent's own signal of whether it needs you:
`ok` (going fine, or blocked on something external like a CI run or PR review),
`attention` (a question, a decision, "ready for review"), or `blocked` (stuck,
needs help). Agents set it with `weaver status <level> "<message>"`, which
records both the level and a one-line current-state message; a bare
`weaver status <level>` changes the level and keeps the last message. The
dashboard shows both and lets you filter for sessions that need a human. It
replaces the old guessed working/waiting/idle indicator, which was often wrong —
e.g. it read "idle" while the agent was actually waiting on a background
workflow.

## Adoption

A session's terminal supervisor is independent of the loom daemon: restarting
loom leaves it running, though it does not survive a machine reboot (the sqlite
rows and worktrees do). When the monitor finds a session whose terminal has
vanished, it marks it `orphaned` rather than `done`.

An orphaned session can be adopted — its terminal recreated and its
agent resumed (`claude --continue`):

```sh
loom session adopt <branch>                   # or the "Adopt" button in the web UI
```

Set `server.auto_adopt` to have loom adopt every recoverable session
automatically on startup (off by default):

```sh
weaver config set server.auto_adopt true
```

## GitHub

With the `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, loom tracks each active session's
pull request. A background loop polls `gh pr view` for the branch every 30s and
surfaces the result on the dashboard: a link straight to the PR, its state
(open / draft / merged / closed), the review decision (approved / changes
requested / review required), and a rolled-up CI verdict (checks passing /
failing / pending). The session's Overview tab has a **Refresh** button to
re-poll on demand.

Every session detail has a **Conversation** tab that renders the agent's chat
with the model — user turns, replies, thinking, and tool calls — live and
(via the archive capture below) still there to review after the terminal is gone.

Whenever a session is archived — by the Archive button or automatically on merge
— loom first captures that conversation to disk: it finds the agent's transcript
(Claude Code or Codex), normalizes it, and writes a machine-readable `chat.json`
plus a readable `chat.md` under `session.log_dir`
(default `~/.iris/logs/sessions/<branch>/`). `weaver chatlog` renders the same
log for a live session on the command line.

Once a branch's PR merges, loom archives the session automatically — tearing
down its terminal and worktree while keeping the branch and its weaver history, the
same as the Archive button. Turn either behaviour off in **Settings** or from
the CLI:

```sh
weaver config set github.archive_on_merge false   # keep the worktree after merge
weaver config set github.poll false               # stop polling GitHub entirely
```

Polling is a quiet no-op for repositories without a GitHub remote, or wherever
`gh` is not installed — nothing to configure to opt out there.

## REST API (brief)

Loom serves a JSON API under `/api`; the Vue SPA is the primary consumer.

- `GET /api/health`
- `GET POST /api/sessions`, `GET PATCH DELETE /api/sessions/{id}`,
  `POST /api/sessions/{id}/{note,archive,adopt,github}`,
  `GET /api/sessions/{id}/{diff,log,events}`,
  `GET /api/sessions/{id}/terminal` (WebSocket: xterm.js ⇄ the tapestry PTY)
- `GET /api/branches`, `GET PATCH /api/branches/{id}`,
  `GET POST /api/branches/{id}/issues` (issues claimed by the branch),
  `GET PATCH DELETE /api/issues/{id}`
- `GET /api/repos/recent`, `GET /api/repos/branches?cwd=…`,
  `GET POST /api/repos/issues?repo_root=…` (the repo-wide board / backlog)
- `GET PATCH /api/settings`

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the shape of `SessionView`.

## Server address

`loom server run` binds `127.0.0.1:7878` by default. Set `WEAVER_API` (e.g.
`WEAVER_API=http://127.0.0.1:9000`) to point loom *and* the `loom` CLI at a
different address. `loom server run --addr <host:port>` overrides `WEAVER_API`.
The running daemon records the address it bound in `~/.weaver/server.json`,
so the `loom` CLI finds it with no configuration in the common case.

## Authentication

loom can be exposed off `127.0.0.1` so the dashboard and the API are reachable
without an SSH tunnel — `loom server run --addr 0.0.0.0:7878`, ideally behind a
TLS-terminating reverse proxy. Access is then gated three ways:

- **Local use needs nothing.** Requests from the loopback interface are trusted
  as the machine owner, so the local `loom` CLI, the agent, and overlooker
  scripts keep working with zero configuration. (Turn this off with
  `auth.trust_loopback false` behind a *same-host* proxy — see below.)
- **GitHub or password login** for the web UI. The login screen offers
  "Continue with GitHub" once an OAuth app is configured, plus username/password.
  A fresh install approves one user — **`rjpower`** on GitHub by default
  (override with `LOOM_OWNER_GITHUB` at first run). Add more, set your password,
  and configure GitHub sign-in under **Settings → Account**.
- **API tokens** for automation — the `LOOM_TOKEN` a CI job or a remote `loom`
  CLI presents as a bearer. Mint one under **Settings → Tokens** or:

  ```sh
  loom token add github-actions     # prints the secret once — store it now
  ```

  Then, from anywhere (e.g. a GitHub Actions step that kicks off a session in
  response to a comment):

  ```sh
  export WEAVER_API=https://loom.example.com
  export LOOM_TOKEN=loom_xxxxxxxx
  loom session launch "Investigate the failing test in #123"
  # or hit the API directly:
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LOOM_TOKEN" \
       -H 'content-type: application/json' \
       "$WEAVER_API/api/sessions" -d '{"cwd":"/srv/repo","goal":"..."}'
  ```

To configure **GitHub sign-in**: register an OAuth app on GitHub with the
callback `https://loom.example.com/api/auth/github/callback`, then paste its
client id and secret into Settings → Account (or set `LOOM_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` /
`LOOM_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`).

Behind a **same-host reverse proxy** the proxy's forwarded requests appear to
come from loopback, so set `auth.trust_loopback false` and `auth.cookie_secure
true`. Local automation keeps working: loom mints a machine-local token (at
`~/.weaver/loom-token`, mode 0600) and hands it to its own subprocesses, so only
genuinely remote callers need to present a token or log in.

## Configuration

Settings live in the `settings` table of the sqlite database, shared by both
binaries. Each known setting is declared in a registry (`config.rs`) with a
label, help text, type, and default.

Edit them in the **Settings** pane of the web UI, or from the CLI:

```sh
weaver config ls
weaver config get agent.default
weaver config set agent.default codex
weaver config rm agent.default
```

Notable settings:

- `agent.default` — agent kind launched for a new session when `loom session
  launch` is given no `--agent` (`claude`, `codex`, or `shell`).
- `agent.model` / `agent.effort` — default model and reasoning effort for new
  sessions. The Settings UI populates these from the selected agent type.
- `concierge.runtime` / `concierge.model` / `concierge.effort` — agent, model,
  and reasoning effort used when the Chat concierge starts or resets.
- `server.auto_adopt` — adopt every recoverable session on daemon startup.
- `github.poll` — poll GitHub (via `gh`) for each session's PR, review, and
  check status (on by default; a no-op without `gh` or a GitHub remote).
- `github.archive_on_merge` — archive a session automatically once its PR
  merges (on by default).
- `session.log_dir` — where a session's agent conversation log is captured on
  archive (a normalized `chat.json` + a rendered `chat.md` under
  `<dir>/<branch>/`). Blank ⇒ `~/.iris/logs/sessions`; point it at a persistent
  path when the home dir isn't a mounted volume.
- `terminal.theme` — colour palette for the in-browser terminal: `dark` (the
  classic black background, default) or `light`.
- `auth.trust_loopback` — trust loopback requests as the machine owner (on by
  default; turn off behind a same-host proxy). See [Authentication](#authentication).
- `auth.cookie_secure` — mark the login cookie `Secure` (enable when served over
  HTTPS).
- `auth.base_url` — the public URL loom is reached at, used for the GitHub OAuth
  callback (blank ⇒ derived from the request's Host header).

## Developing weaver

To build, test, or hack on weaver itself, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — it has
the full loop, the pre-commit gate, and the project conventions. The short of
it: `cargo build` compiles the backend and bundles the Vue dashboard into the
`loom` binary (needs Node + npm; a Node-less checkout still builds and serves a
placeholder page), `cargo test --workspace` runs the backend suites, and `cd e2e
&& npm test` runs the Playwright UI suite.

## Environment

- `WEAVER_HOME` — state directory (default `~/.weaver`)
- `WEAVER_DB` — database path (default `$WEAVER_HOME/weaver.db`)
- `WEAVER_API` — loom URL the `loom` CLI talks to (default `http://127.0.0.1:7878`)
- `WEAVER_BRANCH` — override the branch resolver (set by `loom session launch` in the worktree)
- `LOOM_TOKEN` — bearer token the `loom` CLI / automation sends (see [Authentication](#authentication))
- `LOOM_OWNER_GITHUB` — GitHub login seeded as the owner on a fresh database (default `rjpower`)
- `LOOM_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `LOOM_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` — GitHub OAuth app credentials
