//! The table itself is a plain key/value store, but every setting weaver knows
//! about is also declared in [`REGISTRY`] — a single source of truth that gives
//! each key a label, help text, type, default, and group. The registry drives

//! ([`describe`]); the raw [`get`]/[`set`] helpers still accept arbitrary keys
//! so nothing breaks if a setting is read before it is registered.
