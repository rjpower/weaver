# Research Template

Guide for researching and evaluating technical solutions that match project requirements.

## 1. Requirements Gathering

- [ ] Clarify the problem domain and use case
- [ ] Identify must-have features and capabilities
- [ ] Identify nice-to-have features
- [ ] Document constraints (language, platform, licensing, performance)
- [ ] Confirm requirements with user before proceeding

## 2. Candidate Identification

- [ ] Search for established solutions in the space
- [ ] Identify at least 3-5 viable candidates
- [ ] Exclude candidates that fail hard constraints
- [ ] Document each candidate with a brief description

## 3. Candidate Evaluation

For each candidate, evaluate:

- [ ] **Functionality**: Does it meet the must-have requirements?
- [ ] **Maintenance**: Is it actively maintained? Check last commit, release frequency
- [ ] **Community**: Size of user base, quality of documentation, Stack Overflow presence
- [ ] **Maturity**: Version number, production usage, known issues
- [ ] **Integration**: How well does it fit with existing stack?
- [ ] **Performance**: Any benchmarks or known performance characteristics?
- [ ] **Licensing**: Is the license compatible with project needs?

## 4. Comparison Matrix

- [ ] Create a comparison table of candidates against requirements
- [ ] Score each candidate on key criteria
- [ ] Identify clear winners and losers
- [ ] Note any trade-offs between top candidates

## 5. Recommendation

- [ ] Select the recommended solution
- [ ] Provide clear rationale for the choice
- [ ] Document risks or concerns with the selection
- [ ] Suggest mitigation strategies for identified risks
- [ ] Present recommendation to user for approval
