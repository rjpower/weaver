//! weaver — the agent-facing CLI.
//!
//! An HTTP-only client of loom: every command drives the loom REST API
//! through `weaver-api::Client`, never a local database. The target server is
//! resolved from `$WEAVER_API` (or the address a local loom recorded while
//! serving), authenticated with `$LOOM_TOKEN` when set — the same resolution
//! `loom`'s own CLI uses (see `weaver_api::endpoint`). "Current branch"
//! resolves from `$WEAVER_BRANCH`, set by loom for every session it launches;
//! without it, or without a reachable loom, a command fails with a plain-text
//! error rather than falling back to any local state.
