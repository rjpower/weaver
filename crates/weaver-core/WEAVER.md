You are running inside a **weaver session**: a detached agent workstream in a
git worktree on its own branch. The user is not watching this terminal — they
review progress asynchronously through the loom dashboard.

This document describes how to work *with weaver*. It is distinct from any
`AGENTS.md` in the repo, which describes the project itself — read that too.

## The `weaver` CLI

It is on your `PATH`. From anywhere in the worktree you can run:

- `weaver goal` — print the task this branch was created for.
- `weaver summary` — a quick catch-up on the branch: the goal, your current
  status, the outstanding tasks, and a hint or two for what to do next. Run it
  when you pick up or resume a branch. After a context compaction weaver replays
  this catch-up for you automatically, so you don't lose track of where you are.
- `weaver readme` — print this guide (the full weaver workflow). Re-read it when
  you need the rules back — e.g. after a compaction, when only the concise
  catch-up was replayed.
- `weaver set-status <level> "<message>"` — tell the dashboard how you are
  doing. `level` is one of `ok`, `attention`, or `blocked`; the message is a
  short current-state note ("Wired up routes; tests pass"). This is your single
  channel for reporting status — both the level and the message in one call —
  and the trail of these messages is your progress log: record a decision or
  where you left off by setting the status, not in a separate note.
- `weaver issue add "<title>"` — add a task claimed by this branch (`--repo`
  files it in the shared repo backlog instead).
- `weaver issue ls` — this branch's tasks plus the unclaimed repo backlog
  (`--mine` for just yours, `--repo` for the whole repo). `weaver issue close N`.
- `weaver issue show N` — an issue plus the live status of the branch working
  it; `weaver issue wait N` blocks until it closes or that branch needs you
  (see "Launching and tracking sub-sessions" below).
- `weaver artifact write <name> [<file>]` — write a versioned document to
  weaver (a design, a report, a diagram, a plan) for the user to read. Prints a
  dashboard URL to hand them. Reads stdin with `-`; `--repo` makes it
  repo-shared so a fan-out of child sessions sees one copy. `weaver artifact ls`
  lists this branch's plus the shared ones; `weaver artifact show <name> [--rev
  N]` prints content.
- `weaver goal set <file|->` — set the branch goal from a file or stdin (long
  markdown goals without the shell-quoting pain). `weaver goal` prints it.
- Division of labor: **goal = the charter (what to do); issues = the only task
  ledger; artifacts = documents for the user to read.** A "plan" is just *an
  artifact named `plan`* following smartdoc conventions: prose, a mermaid
  diagram, and a task list whose items **reference issues** (`- #41 Index
  layer`) instead of declaring them. The doc never states status — the dashboard
  projects live issue state at render time. There is no sync engine: **you are
  the reconciler.** File the issues with `weaver issue add`, reference them in
  the doc, and keep the two aligned as work moves. See the smartdoc skill
  (`.agents/skills/smartdoc.md`).
- `weaver set-status` — with no argument, show the goal, status, and open-issue
  count.

These talk directly to the weaver database — no daemon required.

## Your tracking issue

This branch has a **tracking issue** — a weaver issue claimed by your branch
that represents the task you were launched for. `weaver issue ls --mine` shows
it. It is how the agent (or human) that launched you watches your progress
without reading this terminal:

- Keep your status honest with `weaver set-status` as you work — that is the
  live signal whoever launched you polls.
- When the task is genuinely complete (the PR is open, the work is done), run
  `weaver issue close <id>` on the tracking issue. Closing it is the
  unambiguous "this sub-tree is finished" signal; leaving it open means "still
  in flight". Do not close it early.

## Launching and tracking sub-sessions

You can fan work out into its own detached session — a parallel sub-tree on its
own branch and worktree — and track it the same way someone tracks you:

- `loom session launch "<what the sub-agent should do>"` — spawn a sub-session.
  It prints the new branch and a **tracking issue number** for the task; that
  issue is your handle on the sub-tree. The new branch forks from a
  freshly-fetched `origin/<default branch>` unless you pass `--base <branch>`.
- `weaver issue show <id>` — poll the sub-tree: its tracking issue's
  open/closed state plus the sub-agent's live `set-status` (attention +
  current-state message).
- `weaver issue wait <id>` — block until the sub-tree finishes (its tracking
  issue closes) or needs you (the sub-agent raises its attention to
  `attention`/`blocked`). Takes `--timeout <secs>`; prints why it woke.
- `weaver issue ls` lists the sub-tasks you have delegated under
  "Delegated by this branch", each with its sub-agent's current status.

The tracking issue is the high-level handle; `loom session` also drives a child
session's terminal directly, so you can nudge it without attaching:

- `loom session poll <session>` — one-shot status (lifecycle + attention).
- `loom session wait <session>` — block on the session itself (not its issue)
  until it finishes, is lost, or raises attention. `--timeout <secs>`.
- `loom session send <session> "<message>"` — type a message into the
  sub-agent's pane and submit it, triggering an agent round (e.g. to answer a
  question it asked or redirect it).
- `loom session break <session>` — send Escape to interrupt its current turn.
- `loom session preview <session>` — print its recent terminal screen, to see what
  it's doing right now. A session key is an id, branch id, branch name, or
  `repo:branch`.

This duplicates some of a coding agent's builtin sub-agents, but a weaver
sub-session is fully decoupled: it survives independently, has its own git
history, and you can hand it off or revisit it later.

## Signalling your status

The user scans the dashboard for sessions that need them. Keep your status
honest with `weaver set-status <level> "<message>"`. The level is the
"does this need me?" signal; the message says what's going on:

- `ok` — progressing normally, **or** blocked on something external that is not
  the user (a CI run, a PR review, a long workflow). No action needed.
  Example: `weaver set-status ok "waiting on PR review feedback"`.
- `attention` — you want the user to look: a question, a decision to confirm, or
  "done — ready for review". Example: `weaver set-status attention "ready for review"`.
- `blocked` — you are stuck or hit an error and need help to proceed.
  Example: `weaver set-status blocked "build broken, can't reproduce locally"`.

Set it as your situation changes — especially raise it to `attention` before you
finish a turn expecting the user, and drop back to `ok` once you are moving
again. A bare `weaver set-status ok` lowers the level and keeps your last
message. This replaces the old guessed working/waiting/idle indicator, which was
often wrong (e.g. it read "idle" while you were really waiting on a workflow).

Under the hood, status is stored as **tags** on your branch. A tag is a single
`(key, value)` annotation with a note, an author, and a timestamp. Two keys are
well known:

- `attention` — your self-report, the value being `attention` or `blocked`. This
  is what `weaver set-status` writes; `ok` is the absence of the tag, so
  `set-status ok` clears it. Absence is the calm state — a calm branch carries no
  attention tag, only its `description` message.
- `triage` — an overlooker's outside assessment of your branch, the same
  `attention`/`blocked` ladder but authored by an overlooker (or `manual`), never
  by you. It is independent of your `attention` tag and carries its own reason
  and attribution.

Your prose `description` is separate from the tags and is shown even when you are
calm. Any other key is a free-form, quiet tag. A tag is stale once your session
has moved on since it was set (its timestamp predates your last activity).

## How to work here

- Prefer to make a well-reasoned decision, record it with `weaver set-status`,
  and keep going. Default to recording and continuing rather than stopping.
- You may still ask the user for feedback in plain prose when a choice genuinely
  matters. But **never block on an interactive TUI prompt** — multiple-choice
  menus, plan-approval dialogs, and the like cannot be answered from the
  dashboard. State the question as plain text and
  set `weaver set-status attention "<the question>"`, then continue with your
  best assumption.

## Finishing work

You are on a dedicated branch in your own worktree. There is no "merge" button —
integrating your work back is a deliberate act, and it is yours to drive. When
the work is ready:

- **Commit** your changes with a clear message and keep the worktree clean.
- **Run the project's checks** — formatters, linters, pre-commit hooks, and the
  test suite — and make them pass before you call the work done. If the repo
  documents specific commands (often in `AGENTS.md`), use those.
- **Open a pull request** rather than merging into the base branch yourself,
  unless the user has told you otherwise. Most teams gate integration on review
  and CI; respect that. Use the project's normal PR workflow (e.g. `gh pr
  create`).
- Raise `weaver set-status attention "ready for review"` (the message doubles as
  your concise summary, and file any follow-ups as issues with `weaver issue
  add`) so the user knows to look.

When a session is finished with, the user may **archive** it from the dashboard:
that tears down this terminal session and removes the worktree, but preserves the
branch and the weaver history (goal, status, events) for future reference. So
make sure anything worth keeping is committed to the branch or filed as an issue
before you consider the task complete.
