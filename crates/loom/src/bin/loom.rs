//! loom — the orchestration CLI.
//!
//! Most subcommands talk to the running loom daemon over HTTP (session
//! lifecycle, archive, adopt). `loom server run` runs the daemon itself in the
//! foreground; `loom server start`/`stop`/`restart`/`status` manage its
//! background lifecycle. To interact with an agent, `loom session attach` to its
//! terminal (the browser terminal is the other interaction surface).
