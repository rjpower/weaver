//! Integration suites for the loom server. Each module drives a real server
//! (shelling out to `git` + `tmux`) through the shared `fixtures::TestServer`
//! harness. The cases are serialized (`#[serial]`) because that harness mutates
//! process-global env — see `fixtures.rs`.
//!
//! The `hook` event → session-status path is covered separately by
//! `tests/hook_monitor.rs`, so it is not duplicated here.
