"""Agent lint review — run the docs/lint.md catalog over a diff and error on slop.

The "claude shell technique" (borrowed from marin-community/marin): build one
prompt = the lint catalog + instructions + the diff, pipe it to `claude -p`
(print/headless mode) as a fresh isolated session, and parse the findings it
prints back. `cargo fmt` / `clippy` own the mechanical checks; this catches the
judgement-call slop an LLM coding agent tends to leave behind — naming, shape,
dead code, duplication, comment/test quality. See docs/lint.md.

Run it as a step in the commit → PR flow (the `pull-request` skill), after you
commit and before you open the PR. It is deliberately NOT wired into the
pre-commit hook — that stays a fast fmt + clippy gate (scripts/pre-commit.sh),
so a slow or flaky review never sits in the commit path. It reviews the whole
branch against its merge-base with main.

Usage:
  scripts/lint-review.py            # review this branch vs its merge-base with main

Exit status:
  0  no blocking findings — or the review was skipped (see below)
  1  one or more findings at/above the blocking confidence threshold

The review SKIPS (exit 0) when it can't run a clean pass: `claude` not on PATH,
no in-scope changes, the agent timing out, or the agent itself erroring. A flaky
or absent agent must not block progress — only real findings do.

Knobs (env vars):
  WEAVER_SKIP_AGENT_LINT=1            skip the review entirely
  WEAVER_LINT_AGENT_CMD="claude -p"   headless agent invocation (stdin -> findings)
  WEAVER_LINT_MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.9      findings at/above this confidence block
  WEAVER_LINT_TIMEOUT=600             seconds before the agent run is abandoned

Escape hatch for a false positive: add `// wl-allow: <code>` on the cited line
(see docs/lint.md).

# the *parent* branch mid-review, corrupting the dashboard and `loom session wait`
