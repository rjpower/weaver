# Restricted GitHub sessions

Restricted sessions let a trusted GitHub Actions workflow supply a complete,
one-shot prompt without giving the agent Weaver's normal issue-solving prelude
or an unrestricted developer environment. Loom supplies the security envelope;
the workflow owns task semantics, stale-write checks, and prose policy.

The stock `github_comment` profile uses Claude over ACP with no Weaver prelude,
no repository environment or setup script, no Claude user/project/local
settings, repository-scoped read tools, and a fixed GitHub issue/PR MCP surface.
The MCP bridge calls a session-scoped Loom endpoint; Loom runs `gh` server-side
against the session's fixed repository and linked issue/PR number, so neither a
general shell nor the GitHub token enters the agent process. Anything outside
the configured Claude permission rules is rejected by Loom.
The profile intentionally has no token in its seed. Configure a least-privilege
CI identity as its write-only `GH_TOKEN` before enabling a federation mapping.
Its stock policy lives in `crates/loom/profiles/github_comment.json`, not in a
schema migration. Loom seeds a missing stock profile through normal validation
and does not overwrite later operator edits. Custom profiles use the same
REST/CLI/UI or deployment-reconciliation contract; loading policy implicitly
from a managed checkout would let repository content choose its own launch
boundary and is deliberately unsupported.

## GitHub Actions request

The caller job needs `id-token: write`. A composite action runs under the
calling workflow's OIDC identity, so Loom's federation mapping must name the
caller's numeric repository id and exact workflow ref—not the composite action's
repository.

After constructing the full prompt in `prompt_file`, the job exchanges its OIDC
token and submits the run:

```bash
set -euo pipefail

audience=$(jq -rn --arg value "$LOOM_URL" '$value|@uri')
oidc_token=$(curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN" \
  "$ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL&audience=$audience" | jq -r .value)
loom_token=$(curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg token "$oidc_token" '{token:$token}')" \
  "$LOOM_URL/api/auth/federate" | jq -r .token)

request=$(jq -n \
  --arg repo "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" \
  --arg title "Prose cleanup for #$NUMBER" \
  --arg key "prose-cleanup:$KIND:$NUMBER:$BODY_HASH" \
  --rawfile goal "$prompt_file" \
  --argjson number "$NUMBER" \
  '{
    profile: "github_comment",
    idempotency_key: $key,
    source: "actions",
    session: {
      repo: $repo,
      title: $title,
      goal: $goal,
      github_issue: $number
    }
  }')
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $loom_token" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "$request" "$LOOM_URL/api/runs"
```

GitHub caller keys accept up to 128 ASCII letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `:`, and
`-`. Loom namespaces them by verified repository and subject. An empty key keeps
the compatibility behavior of deduplicating one workflow run attempt; a body
hash key converges retries and reruns for the same source description.

Do not put `GH_TOKEN` in the request or prompt. Automation requests are stored
for audit and idempotency. The token belongs in the profile's write-only
environment, preferably as a deployment-managed Secret Manager reference. Loom
resolves it only while executing a fixed GitHub tool. The existing human/comment
launch path uses the approved requester's stored GitHub token by default, also
server-side for a restricted session.

## Production rollout

1. Declare `github_comment` in the production Pulumi profile manifest with its
   `GH_TOKEN` secret reference, and grant the Loom VM access to that secret.
2. Add one `githubFederations` entry per approved caller workflow, constrained
   to the numeric repository id, exact workflow ref, event/ref where useful, and
   only `github_comment`.
3. Deploy the merged Loom image and reconcile the manifest. Audit with `loom
   profile show github_comment` and `loom federation ls`.
4. Run a synthetic issue through the direct API. Verify the prompt appears as
   the first turn without `WEAVER.md`, a duplicate body-hash key returns the
   original run, no shell or code-writing tool is visible, the agent environment
   contains no GitHub token, and only the requested GitHub mutation occurs.
5. Change the Marin prose-cleanup action from posting `@weaverbot` to the OIDC
   exchange above, keeping its current body-hash/stale-write prompt. Roll the
   action revision through `marin-community/*` consumers in batches.

Disable the federation mapping or remove the profile token to stop new runs.
That rollback does not affect interactive Loom sessions.
