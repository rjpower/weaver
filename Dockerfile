# Claude Code — the agent runtime loom's sessions launch — is installed in two
# places on purpose:
#
#   * a baked *fallback* here under /opt/claude (root-owned, deliberately kept
#     OFF /usr/local/bin and placed last on PATH, so it never shadows the
#     writable copy). It exists only so a brand-new or offline container still
#     has a working `claude`.
#   * the real copy the entrypoint lays down at first boot into the app user's
#     $HOME/.local — on the persisted loom_home volume, so it is writable. That
#     one wins on PATH, and because it lives on a writable volume Claude Code's
#     background auto-updater works and the updates survive container recreates.
#
# A bare `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (the old approach) lands in the
# read-only, root-owned npm global dir and makes Claude report it "can't update".

# bundles its own Node, so it's self-contained on bookworm (glibc 2.28+) and
# doesn't couple to the system node above. Pinned; bump deliberately. Without it
# loom still runs — the editor panel just reports "not installed".
