# Design Template

Guide for creating a comprehensive implementation design based on research and user requirements.

## 1. Context Summary

- [ ] Summarize the problem being solved
- [ ] Reference the research document and key findings
- [ ] State the selected approach and rationale
- [ ] Document any constraints or requirements that affect design

## 2. System Architecture

- [ ] Define the high-level system structure
- [ ] Identify major components and their responsibilities
- [ ] Document external dependencies and integrations
- [ ] Create a component diagram if helpful

## 3. Component Design

For each major component:

- [ ] Define the component's interface (inputs, outputs)
- [ ] Document internal structure and key abstractions
- [ ] Identify data models and schemas
- [ ] Note any state management requirements

## 4. Component Interactions

- [ ] Document how components communicate
- [ ] Define API contracts between components
- [ ] Identify data flow through the system
- [ ] Document error handling and failure modes

## 5. Code Examples

- [ ] Provide code snippets for key patterns
- [ ] Show example usage of main interfaces
- [ ] Demonstrate integration points
- [ ] Include configuration examples if applicable

## 6. Trade-off Analysis

- [ ] Document design decisions and alternatives considered
- [ ] Analyze trade-offs for each major decision
- [ ] Identify potential future issues or limitations
- [ ] Note areas that may need revisiting

## 7. User Feedback Integration

- [ ] Present design to user for review
- [ ] Gather feedback on proposed approach
- [ ] Address concerns and questions
- [ ] Incorporate feedback into design

## 8. Final Design Sign-off

- [ ] Confirm all requirements are addressed
- [ ] Verify design is implementable with selected tools
- [ ] Document any open questions or decisions deferred
- [ ] Obtain user approval to proceed to implementation
