//! The terminal-management seam.
//!
//! Loom's programmatic terminal operations — create a session, check liveness,
//! capture the screen, type into it, kill it — go through here rather than
//! poking the supervisor directly, so the call sites read uniformly and the
//! `tapestry`-specific glue (binary resolution, key-name → bytes) lives in one
//! place.
//!
//! Every session is a [`tapestry`] supervisor: a per-session detached PTY process
//! that streams raw PTY bytes, so an attached xterm owns its own scrollback,
//! selection, and search. Its lifetime is independent of `loom serve`, so a loom
//! restart leaves running terminals untouched — the recovery property that keeps
//! agents alive across restarts.
